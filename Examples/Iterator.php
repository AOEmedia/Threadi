/**
 * This example shows the usage of the thread pool feature in combination with an iterator.
 *
 * If you have a large collection of something and you need to do something on every element
 * you can create a thread pool and use following sample code to have your collection being
 * processed by multiple worker threads at the same time.
 * As soon as one thread has finished his work the thread pool is ready to get a new thread.
 * So this loop manages itself and takes care that all collection items are being processed
 * as fast as possible
